Preprocessing module should handle different paragraphs formats in images like:
• Text alignment • Text color
• Text size/weight • Text rotation
• Image blur • Salt and pepper noise
• Brightness variation

Preprocessing:
1 - Fixing rotation
2 - Binarize
3 - Cropping image to only fit the text area 

Feature extraction:
Added build_features.ipnyb for feature extraction.
Used gabor filter and area ratio as features. Added energy val to gabor filter.
Used this file to extract features from 200 images per font (in total 800) took 100 minutes.
The output file with the xtracted features is features_200.csv


In model.ipnyb:
Split the dataset into training and validation then tested using the following models:
 1- Gaussian Naive Bayes
 2- Linear Discriminant ANalysis
 3- Quadratic Discriminant ANalysis
 4- Kernel Density estimation then Bayes Classifier
 5- SVM
